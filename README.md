# AI Edge Benchmarking

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the AI Edge Benchmarking team!

## Current Features
Using the `benchmarking.py` script, we are able to record:
- Current
- Inferencing Time
- Power

Raw values are stored in addition to offset values, which come from isolating spikes from idle power consumption. This is more impactful for larger boards such as those in the single board computer class. 

## Current State

- Raspberry Pi Pico
