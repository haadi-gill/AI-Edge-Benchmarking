# Edge Impulse library for video_tinyml_raw

This is a C++ library that lets you run the impulse for "video_tinyml_raw" (https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/628409) on any device. It consists of the Edge Impulse inferencing SDK - with implementations of both processing and learning blocks - and your model. You will need to include this library in your project to run your impulse locally.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the following documentation to learn how to use this library:

* Deploy your model as a C++ library: https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/deploy-your-model-as-a-c-library
* Running your impulse locally: https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/running-your-impulse-locally-1
* C++ Inference SDK Library API Reference: https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/reference/inferencing-sdk

## Example Projects

For example projects, see 'Running your impulse locally' in the docs (https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/running-your-impulse-locally-1). These pages have examples for virtually any platform under the sun including Linux, Mbed OS, Zephyr, FreeRTOS, and bare-metal on a wide range of platforms. These examples also show how to enable hardware acceleration on Cortex-M, Cortex-A, ARC DSPs and other platforms.
